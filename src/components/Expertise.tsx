                    <h3>Back-End Development</h3>
                    <p>
                        I specialize in Back-End Development, focusing on building robust, scalable, and efficient server-side applications. I primarily work with JavaScript (Node.js) to develop and integrate APIs with various databases, including SQL and NoSQL. My focus is on creating efficient, scalable, and maintainable back-end systems that support dynamic applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have experience in designing RESTful APIs, handling database interactions, and optimizing performance. While authentication and authorization are not my strongest areas, I continuously improve my skills to build secure and reliable back-end solutions. My goal is to refine my expertise and develop high-performing, scalable architectures for modern web and mobile applications.

                    <h3>Cloud Engineering</h3>
                    <p>
                        I specialize in Cloud Engineering, focusing on designing, deploying, and optimizing cloud-based solutions. Through the Bangkit Academy 2024 Cloud Computing Cohort, supported by Google, Tokopedia, Gojek, and Traveloka, I have gained hands-on experience in cloud infrastructure, networking, security, and DevOps practices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By working on real-world projects, I have developed expertise in scalable architectures, containerization (Docker), a little CI/CD pipelines, and cloud security best practices. My goal is to obtain industry-recognized cloud certifications and leverage my skills to build high-performance, resilient, and cost-efficient cloud solutions that drive innovation and efficiency. üöÄ‚òÅÔ∏è

                    <h3>Containerization</h3>
                    <p>
                        I specialize in Containerization, primarily using Docker to create lightweight, portable, and efficient containers for back-end applications. My focus is on building optimized container images, managing multi-container environments with Docker Compose, and ensuring smooth deployment in local and cloud environments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    While I‚Äôm not deeply experienced with Kubernetes, I have a strong understanding of container fundamentals, basic networking, and resource optimization. My goal is to enhance scalability and deployment efficiency by leveraging Docker to streamline application development and deployment workflows. üöÄüê≥
